# Collaborative Work

A collection of all the codes written in collabaration with other cohort members during the WE(Women in engineering) bootcamp. Each problem of each task performed is given below.

-------------------------------------------------
### Lewis Carol
> A problem to generate a word ladder from a given word to the final desired word in minimum steps. We also need to ensure that the intermediate words formed by the change of letters are legitimate words in the sowpods file.

-------------------------------------------------

### Task 1
 > Generate ranklist from marklist.txt
 
-------------------------------------------------

### Task2

> Program an odometer with digits in an increasing order .
> Given an input return the previous and the next reading of that odometer.

-------------------------------------------------

### Task3

> Given a text file of different marks of three subjects print out the pairs where one student has greater than the other in all subjects.
> Don't print transitive relations. eg. if A > B and B > C don't print A > C .

-------------------------------------------------

### Task4

> Print the scoring of a Tennis mathch given a string input of the order in which the Players win a point.
eg Input : "AABBAABAA"\
Output :0 0\
        1 0\
        30 15\
        
------------------------------------------------

### Task5

 > Hackerrank Bread "Fair Rations Problem".

------------------------------------------------
### Task6

> This task was to implement Task2 and Task4 using OOPS.

------------------------------------------------
### Task7

> Task7 was a word game that followed a certain set of rules.
* The user thinks of a particular word and inputs the length of the word he has thought.
* The computer guesses a word of the same length for which the user enters the set of the no. of letters similar in those two words.
* The computer then eventually guesses the word.
* This game can also be played the other way round.

--------------------------------------------------
### Task8

> The task was to implement the card game known as diamonds.

----------------------------------------------------
### Task9

> The cohort students were given almost 45 minutes to implement the othello game on the command line.
------------------------------------------------------

* Note: Each task has been completed under a time crunch of less than 45 minutes with the collaborators sitting at four ends of a stretched room.
